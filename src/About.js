                <p>The day we stayed home, was the first of many. One thing didn't change. People needed food. As the days mounted. Food chain distruptions emerged and many people just ate cereal. Others though outside the box and bought CSA from a local farm.</p>
                <p>Jerad decided to not let that Kohlrabi shrivel up and die again. He knew it was delicious but didn't know how to wrangle that sucker. Thoughts of wasting food plagued his mind, education. Armed with new cooking skills from his friend Blackwell. A collection of food histories from his wife Stephanie. Jerad could confront his Quarantine Kitchen with confidence.</p>
                <p>No it's not that serious! We gather once a week and talk through cooking techniques, tell stories, learn the origins of a dish and try new flavor combinaitions. Having a bowl full of laughs along the way! </p>
